<h2>How to check the current commits log of a remote repo in Git:</h2>
<b>Commit after commit, Git builds up a log. You can find out the remote repository log by using this command</b>

<code>git log origin/main</code>

<h2>How to merge a remote repo with your local repo in Git:</h2>
<b>If the remote repository has changes you want to merge with your local, then this command will do that for you:</b>

<code>git merge origin/main</code>

<h2>How to get the contents of remote branches in Git without automatically merging:</h2>
<b>This lets you update the remote without merging any content into the
local branches. You can call git merge or git checkout to do the merge.</b>

<code>git remote update</code>

<h2>How to push a new branch to a remote repo in Git:</h2>
<b>If you want to push a branch to a remote repository you can use the command below. Just remember to add -u to create the branch upstream:</b>

<code>git push -u origin branch_name</code>

<h2>How to remove a remote branch in Git:</h2>
<b>If you no longer need a remote branch you can remove it using the command below:</b>

<code>git push --delete origin branch_name</code>

<h2>How to use Git rebase:</h2>
<b>You can transfer completed work from one branch to another using git rebase.</b><br>
<b>Git Rebase can get really messy if you don't do it properly. Before using this command I suggest that you re-read the official documentation <i style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://git-scm.com/book/it/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing">here</a></i></b>

<code>git rebase branch_name</code>

<h2>How to run rebase interactively in Git:</h2>
<b>You can run git rebase interactively using the -i flag.<br>
It will open the editor and present a set of commands you can use.</b>

<code>git rebase -i master</code><br>
<code># p, pick = use commit</code><br>
<code># r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message</code><br>
<code># e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending</code><br>
<code># s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit</code><br>
<code># f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message</code><br>
<code># x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell</code><br>
<code># d, drop = remove commit</code>

<h2>How to force a push request in Git:</h2>
<b>This command will force a push request. This is usually fine for pull request branches because nobody else should have cloned them.
But this isn't something that you want to do with public repos.</b>

<code>git push -f</code>
